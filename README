dvd_transcode takes a list of video files and transcodes them into DVD compliant MPEG-2 (NTSC).

The output is stored next to the source file(s) but with the extension .mpg instead.

Usage:

	dvd_transcode file [file ...]

Example:

	dvd_transcode ~/Movies/our_holiday_video.mkv

	This will transcode our_holiday_video.mkv into MPEG-2 and save the result as ~/Movies/our_holiday_video.mpg
